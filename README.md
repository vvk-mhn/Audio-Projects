# Audio-Projects
This repository contains some personal projects of mine related to audio and DSP.

faust-effects: This folder contains Faust implementations of some gain, modulation and time-based effects; the idea is to try and incorporate some of these effects as unit generators as part of Arco, a signal processing server created by Dr. Roger Dannenberg. You can check out the Arco repository [here](https://github.com/rbdannenberg/arco).
